#####

The Dylan Foundry is working on tools and libraries to make it easier to
use the `Dylan <http://opendylan.org/>`_ programming language in production.

Currently under development are libraries covering these areas:

* Database access, including sqlite3, PostgreSQL and LevelDB.
* An improved networking library.
* Improvements to the Dylan HTTP libraries.
* ... and lots more.

The Dylan Foundry is sponsored by `DataFueled <http://datafueled.com/>`_.
