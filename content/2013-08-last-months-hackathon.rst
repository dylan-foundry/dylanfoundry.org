Last month, we had our first hack-a-thon in many years.  Attendance was
spread out over the weekend and some great contributions got completed.

* Carl Gay documented our `regular expressions library`_.
* Peter Housel made more solid progress on our LLVM compiler back-end.
* Dustin Voss improved some aspects of our support for limited collections.
* Ingo Promovicz improved support for locking I/O streams.
* Bruce Mitchener worked on merging run-time libraries to help provide more
  consistent support for various features across the various compiler back-ends.
* Francesco Ceccon worked on the gobject-introspection bindings and the generator
  for creating C-FFI bindings for the GTK+ family of libraries.
* Hannes Mehnert addressed some issues in the networking library surrounding
  localhost connections.
* Andreas Bogk returned from the dead and observed the goings on after a
  multi-year absence.
* Tom Emerson began investigating providing support for Unicode in Dylan.
* Robert Roland enhanced the `sqlite bindings`_.

Thanks to everyone who participated and we're looking forward to our
next hack-a-thon in a couple of months.

All of these changes and much much more will be present in our upcoming 2013.2
release!
