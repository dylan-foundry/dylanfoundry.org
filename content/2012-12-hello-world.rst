As part of the work that `DataFueled <http://datafueled.com/>`_ is
doing, we are sponsoring work in the `Dylan <http://opendylan.org/>`_
programming language. This work is being done under the umbrella of
the Dylan Foundry.

The Dylan Foundry is where we'll be blogging about the work that we're
up to, what our future plans might be, and the libraries that we've
developed.

The Dylan Foundry will also be assisting with issues surrounding the
Dylan development tools as well as deploying Dylan applications into
production in a server environment.
